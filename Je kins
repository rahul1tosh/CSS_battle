Here's a concise summary of each stage in a typical Jenkins pipeline, describing their roles in a DevSecOps CI/CD process:


---

1. Checkout

Purpose: Retrieves source code from a version control system (e.g., Git).

Key Actions: Checks out the latest code from a branch, tag, or commit.



---

2. TruffleHog Scan

Purpose: Detects secrets in the codebase (e.g., API keys, passwords).

Key Actions: Scans git history or files for high-entropy strings or secret patterns.



---

3. Build

Purpose: Compiles the application source code.

Key Actions: Executes build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle, npm) to produce artifacts.



---

4. Inspect

Purpose: Performs code quality and static analysis.

Key Actions: Runs tools like SonarQube or custom linters to detect bugs, smells, and style issues.



---

5. Codesign

Purpose: Signs the built artifacts to verify their authenticity and integrity.

Key Actions: Uses a digital certificate to sign binaries or packages.



---

6. Publish

Purpose: Deploys the build artifact to a repository or registry.

Key Actions: Uploads to Artifactory, Nexus, DockerHub, PyPI, etc.



---

7. Scan

Purpose: General security scanning stage (may be a placeholder for multiple tools).

Key Actions: Runs various security tests (could overlap with Checkmarx/BlackDuck).



---

8. Checkmarx Scan

Purpose: Static Application Security Testing (SAST).

Key Actions: Analyzes source code for vulnerabilities without executing it.



---

9. BlackDuck Scan

Purpose: Software Composition Analysis (SCA).

Key Actions: Identifies open-source components and associated license/compliance risks.



---

10. SCM

Purpose: Source Control Management operations.

Key Actions: Can include commit, push, or update of metadata post-build.



---

11. Tag

Purpose: Marks a specific commit or build in version control.

Key Actions: Creates a Git tag (e.g., v1.2.3) for traceability or release tracking.
