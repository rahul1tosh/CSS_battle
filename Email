Subject: Clarification on Metadata Table for EPPS

Hi Todd,

I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to check with you regarding the metadata storage for EPPS.
What should be the name of the table that will store the metadata fetched from all three resource types â€” project, bucket, and dataset?

Also, is it acceptable to store metadata for all these resource types in a single table, or would you recommend separate tables?

Lastly, should this table be created in the apmf_z_ref dataset, or would you suggest using a different dataset?

Looking forward to your guidance.

Thanks and regards,
Rahul
